<h2>Trigram Next Word Prediction</h2>

This project implements a trigram language model to predict the next word in a given phrase.

We used:

NLTK library (Brown corpus)

Frequency-based probabilities from trigram counts

The model predicts the most probable next word using the last two words as context.
