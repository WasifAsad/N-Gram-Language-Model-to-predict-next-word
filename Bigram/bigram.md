<h2>Bigram Next Word Prediction</h2>

This project implements a bigram language model to predict the next word in a given phrase.

We used NLTK library (Gutenberg corpus). Any other corpus can be used, which can lead to different kinds of outputs.

We used Frequency-based probabilities from bigram counts

The model predicts the most probable next word using the last word as context.
